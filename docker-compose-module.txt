hello-container-1  | Hello from Docker!
hello-container-1  | This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
hello-container-1  | 
hello-container-1  | To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
hello-container-1  |  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
hello-container-1  |  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
hello-container-1  |     (arm64v8)
hello-container-1  |  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
hello-container-1  |     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
hello-container-1  |  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
hello-container-1  |     to your terminal.
hello-container-1  | 
hello-container-1  | To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
hello-container-1  |  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
hello-container-1  |
